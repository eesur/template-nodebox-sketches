# NodeBox code sketches

This is basic flow/way to build your own automated interface for code sketches utilising gitHub pages.

View with example data: [https://eesur.github.io/template-nodebox-sketches/](https://eesur.github.io/template-nodebox-sketches/)

There's just one setting you need to update in the `index.html`, your repo name (around `line 73`), where the render code is (be sure to include the branch). The other option is how may columns you prefer in the webpage (it uses [flex grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes))

``` js
settings: {
    githubUrl: 'https://github.com/eesur/nodebox-daily-sketches/tree/master/',
    columns: 3
}
```


-----------

## setup

prerequisites: 
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- git installed

in your terminal:

0. [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repo to your computer (without the history): `git clone https://github.com/eesur/nodebox-daily-sketches.git && rm -rf nodebox-daily-sketches/.git`
1. run `npm update` to install `package.json` dependencies
2. delete the example sketches and code (So you have a clean slate)
3. create your repo and push to it
4. set up gitHub Pages (just go to setting tab in your repo and turn on github pages)

-----------

## use

### 01. Add yourÂ files
- Save your NodeBox file into the `code` folder
- For each sketch export a `png` image into the `img-ref` folder

**NOTE:** Make sure you name the `code` files and `img` files the same, for example in this template I've named the images `[number-name].png/gif` and the code `[number-name].ndbx`

### 02. Update
- Update the data in the files: `run npm tree` 
- push


-----------

## breakdown of folders/files

- `code`: is a folder containing the code files
- `img-refs`: folder for all the images (png and gif)
- `directory-tree.js`: is the folder structure of the code files
- `imgTee.json`: is the folder structure of the image folders
